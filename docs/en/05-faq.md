### What should I do if the AI gives strange or incorrect answers?
First, check your **prompt**—is it clear and specific? Try rephrasing. Starting a **new conversation** or selecting a **different model** can help.


### What’s the difference between “Custom Instructions” and a “Persona”?
**Custom Instructions** are general, applied to all chats (unless a persona is active). A **Persona** is a complete **role** for a conversation or task and **overrides** your custom instructions.


### What about privacy when I upload documents?
Data in UvA AI Chat follows the same **security and privacy** policies as your UvA emails and documents. It is **not used to train** AI models. Always be cautious with sensitive data. See the policy framework on GenAI in education.


### The AI doesn’t seem to fully understand my long conversations or documents. Why?
Likely a **context window** limit. Start a **new chat** (carry a summary), ask **specific** questions, shorten or split long documents, or select a model with a **larger** context window (if available).


### Why is the UvA developing its own AI infrastructure?
To ensure **digital sovereignty**, **privacy**, **equal access**, **academic freedom**, **transparency** about model impacts, responsible GenAI use, and alignment with scientific integrity guidelines.


### How is it different from ChatGPT?
UvA AI Chat is **managed in‑house** for and by the UvA, keeping input under UvA control and independent of a single LLM via an **intermediary layer**. The front‑end enables tailored experiences for students, lecturers, and researchers.


### Who developed UvA AI Chat?
A multidisciplinary project team from across faculties and services, as part of **NOKI** (“Navigating the Ocean of Artificial Intelligence”).


### How does UvA AI Chat handle data and data protection?
All input/output is **managed by UvA** and protected. Input is **not used** to train models. You can **delete** your chat history (cannot be restored).
