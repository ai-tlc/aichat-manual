## 1.1 Responsible use {#1-1-responsible-use}


UvA AI Chat, like any AI tool, is **not infallible**. The model can present **mistakes, inaccuracies, biases, or incorrect information** as if it were fact. **Never rely blindly** on generated output—**verify** and apply **critical judgment** each time. Also remember that using AI consumes **energy and water**.


**Practical example**
Suppose you ask the AI to summarize a scientific article you’ve uploaded.


- **Irresponsible use:** You copy the summary directly into your own work without verification.
- **Responsible use:** You read the summary, compare it to the original article, and check whether the arguments, methodology, and conclusions are represented correctly. Use AI output as a **supporting tool**, but base your work on the **source text**.


Be mindful of **cognitive offloading**—outsourcing thinking to tools like AI. Overreliance can hinder the development of skills and knowledge and may lessen **critical thinking**. Build your **AI literacy**: learn to ask good questions and carefully check what the AI produces so it truly **supports** your work, learning, and research.


## 1.2 Your first step: logging in {#1-2-login}
