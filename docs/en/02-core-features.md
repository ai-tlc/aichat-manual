- **Positive:** “Write an accessible introduction of around 200 words for my essay on Italo Calvino, aimed at a first‑year student. Use clear, simple language and define the main concepts.”


**Table 1: Examples of positive formulation**


| Task | Ineffective Prompt | Effective Prompt |
|---|---|---|
| Writing an email | “Write an email to my professor.” | **Context:** I need to email my professor, Dr. Jansen, about an extension for my paper on the Eighty Years’ War. **Instruction:** Draft a formal, respectful email requesting a two‑day extension. **Criteria:** Mention unforeseen personal circumstances (without detail) and propose a new submission date. |
| Summarizing text | “Summarize this document.” | **Context:** The uploaded document is a scientific article about the impact of AI on the labor market. **Instruction:** Generate a **bullet‑point** summary. **Criteria:** Focus on methodology, main findings, and conclusions. **Language:** Dutch. **Length:** ≤ 250 words. |
| Brainstorming | “Give me ideas for an argument.” | **Context:** I’m a sociology researcher writing about social inequality. **Instruction:** Generate **five** concrete, essay‑worthy standpoints. **Criteria:** Original, empirically grounded, and relevant to contemporary Dutch society. |
| Requesting feedback | “Check my text.” | **Context:** Attached file is the draft introduction of my research proposal. **Audience:** Researchers in my field. **Instruction:** Provide **constructive feedback**. **Criteria:** Analyze (1) clarity of problem statement, (2) logical structure, (3) academic style. Give concrete examples and specific improvements. |

## 2.2 “My prompts”: your personal collection of instructions {#2-2-my-prompts}


**My prompts** helps you work efficiently by **reusing** effective prompts (book icon in the left sidebar). It includes **predefined prompts** (e.g., writing feedback, multiple‑choice generation) that you can adapt.


You can also **save your own prompts**—useful for recurring tasks.


**Practical example: Saving a custom prompt**


1. Draft your effective prompt.
2. Go to **My prompts** → **Add prompt**.
3. Name it clearly (e.g., *Academic English Check*).
4. Paste a detailed instruction (editor role, formal alternatives, consistency, readability).
5. Save. Reuse quickly via the **book icon** below the chat box.


**Letting the AI search the internet**
UvA AI Chat has a **knowledge cutoff**. To work with **recent** info, enable **Internet Search** (Swiss‑army‑knife icon → check **Internet Search**). State in your prompt that the AI should **use the internet** (e.g., “Search the internet for …”). This feature is still **in development**.

## 2.3 Uploading and analyzing documents {#2-3-docs}


Upload files via the **paperclip** below the text box; uploaded docs are available to the current conversation.


**Supported formats:** PDF, DOCX, XLS, PPT, CSV. Large, unusual, or password‑protected files may not process; if a document is very large (e.g., 100+ pages), retrieval becomes challenging.


**Workflow**
Uploaded docs do nothing until you **instruct** the AI. Combine upload with a **precise prompt** (analyze, summarize, translate, retrieve specifics).


**Practical workflow example**


1. **Upload** a 50‑page PDF.
2. **Prompt:** “Analyze the uploaded report and identify sections related to sustainable policy. Summarize key recommendations in bullet points and cite page numbers.”


**Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)**
The system retrieves up to **10** relevant snippets from your uploaded documents and **augments** your prompt before the model answers. This allows accurate, source‑grounded results but isn’t designed to **summarize very large texts** end‑to‑end.

## 2.4 Generating and analyzing images {#2-4-images}


UvA AI Chat can **generate images** from descriptions (use detailed prompts) and **analyze uploaded images** (photo icon). The image generator is **not yet reliable** for images containing **text**.


**Prompting example**


- **Too general:** “Generate a tulip.”
- **Detailed:** “Generate an image in the style of a 19th‑century botanical illustration: a tulip with fine line details for petals, stem, and leaves; parchment‑like textured background.”


For **analysis**, upload an image and specify what to analyze. Note: the AI may not always accurately interpret **text, charts, or tables** embedded in images.

## 2.5 Artifacts {#2-5-artifacts}


**Artifacts** are collaborative, editable windows (text/code/visuals) that both you and the AI can **co‑edit**—turning the AI into more of a **creative partner**.


**How to use Artifacts**


1. **Activate** *Artifact Creation* (slider menu).
2. **Instruct:** e.g., “Create an artifact comparing Keynesian and Neoclassical economic theories.”
3. **Review** generated output.
4. **Collaborate:** Edit directly, or instruct the AI; select specific text for targeted edits.
5. **Save & versioning:** Save manual edits before asking AI to continue. New AI edits auto‑save as **new versions**; browse history. **Download** via the top‑right menu.

## 2.6 Study Mode {#2-6-study-mode}


**Study Mode** turns the assistant into a **guiding tutor**. Instead of immediate answers, the AI asks questions, offers hints, and waits for your responses—helping you **practice reasoning** and avoid over‑reliance.


**How to use**


1. **Activate** Study Mode (slider menu) and **set a learning goal** (what you want to learn; what you already know).
2. **Work in dialogue:** Ask for smaller steps, hints, or feedback; request formats (MCQ, examples, metaphors).
3. **Adjust pace/level:** “Use simpler language,” “Make it harder,” “Go faster/slower.”
4. **Conclude:** Ask for a recap or practice questions; consider using **Artifacts** to save and refine notes.
